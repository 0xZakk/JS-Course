# Review
The following is suggested reading for you, if you'd like to review any of the material we've covered in the first part of the course.

I recommend that you finish it before next Monday's class, when we start Part 2 of this course. By no means is any of this *assigned*, it's for your own interest and education.

In particular, these chapters for review:

1. Values, Types, and Operators
2. Program Structure
3. Functions
4. Data Structures: Objects and Arrays
8. Bugs and Error Handling

These chapters for a little more depth

5. Higher-order Functions
