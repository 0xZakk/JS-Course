### HTTP recap
- Client and Server relationship
- HTTP is their love language

### The History of Ajax
- Ajax is open source and thus accessible
- The term AJAX was not used until 2005, but development had been underway since around 1996
- It canâ€™t be credited to just one organization or individual.

### Getting to know AJAX
- Ajax is not a programming language or a tool, but a concept.
- Ajax is a client-side script that communicates to and from a server/database without the need for a postback or a complete page refresh
- More narrowly, it refers to the use of XmlHttpRequest objects to interact with a web server dynamically via JavaScript.

### The 4 Benefits of AJAX
1. Callbacks
- Ajax is used to perform a callback, making a quick round trip to and from the server to retrieve and/or save data without posing the entire page back to the server
- What benefits could this have?
2. Asynchronous Calls
- Ajax allows you to make Asynchronous calls to a web server
- The browser can avoid waiting for all data to arrive before allowing the user to act once more
3. User-Friendly
- Ajax enabled applications will always be more responsive, faster and more User-Friendly
4. Increase Speed

### Where can we use Ajax?
- Ajax should be used anywhere in a web application where small amounts of information could be saved or retrieved from the server without posting back the entire pages
- Can we think of any examples?

### Lets explore the technical aspects of Ajax
Exercise 1

### Introducing APIs
--

### A Brief History of APIs
- Web APIs first appeared in the wild with the introduction of Salesforce on February 7th, when the company officially launched its API at the IDG Demo 2000 conference
- Ebay was next to follow suit
- In 2002 Amazon launched AWS
- (AWS) allowed third party sites to search and display products from Amazon.com in an XML format.

### The New Frontier
- Mobile: Foursquare and Instagram
- March 2009: Foursquare launched at the SXSW interactive festival in Austin, TX.
- Foursquare is a location-based mobile platform and utilizes APIs to allow developers to deliver a new generation of location aware, API driven applications
- Web APIs got their start in early e-commerce on the Internet, but without social, a scalable cloud backend and a ubiquitous mobile devices--APIs weren't ready for prime time. In 2012 we reached that points

### Why APIs?
- Websites are designed to cater to people's strengths.
- The characteristics that make websites optimal for humans make them difficult for computers to use.
- What's the solution?

### APIs
- An API is the tool that makes a website's data digestible for a computer
- Through it, a computer can view and edit data

### API and HTTP
- API calls are really a fancy term for making HTTP requests to a server and sending/receiving structured data from that endpoint.
-We are still communicating with URLs, however instead of receiving markup, like we do with HTML pages, we receive data, in a variety of forms -- JSON, XML, CSV, and others.
