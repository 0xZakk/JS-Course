## User Experience Research

--
### Wireframing
Sketch and outline the views of our applications

--
### How to Wireframe
- hand drawn symbols for components of our application
- we can layout these symbols however we like and test out different layouts
- start broad and work your way in

--
### Our first wireframe

--
### Now you make one!

--
### User Journeys
Creating a map of how a user will navigate through and around our applications

--
### Our first user journey

--
### Now you make one!

---
## Deployment

---
### Deploying Static Applications

--
### Static applications/websites
- all html, css and js is already generated (static)
- can then be delivered as is
