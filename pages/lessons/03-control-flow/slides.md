## Introduction to Control Flow

--
## What is Control Flow?
"Control Flow" refers to the order in which statements of a program are evaluated or executed.

--
### Linear Flow

--
### Conditional Flow

--
### If statements
```
if ( EXPRESSION ) {
  CODES
}
```

--
#### If/Else statements
```
if ( EXPRESSION ) {
  CODE TO RUN IF TRUE
} else {
  CODE TO RUN IF FALSE
}
```

--
#### Ternary Statements
```
EXPRESSION ? CODE IF TRUE : CODE IF FALSE;
```

--
#### Lets see it in action!

--
### Iterative Flow

--
#### `for` loops
```
for ( ITERATOR; CONDITION; INCREMENT ) {
  CODES
}
```

--
#### `for ... in` loops
```
for ( VARIABLE in OBJECT ) {
  CODE
}
```

--
#### `while` loops
```
while( CONDITION ) {
  CODE
}
```

--
#### `do while` loops
```
do {
  CODE
} WHILE ( condition )
```

--
#### Lets see it in action!

## Exercise

## Closing
What can I be doing outside of class?

--
### Extracurricular activities
- Go further in learning the command line - learn how to run multiple and/or more complex tasks
- Learn your text editor - these are super powerful tools with hundreds of commands you can memorize to work more quickly and efficiently
- Make a list of the major concepts we discussed in class and go read more about them
- Spend time in your console exploring making small programs or building programs that perform specific calculations
