# Learn You Express

[NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/) is a set of command line based tutorials to learn node and the surrounding ecosystem (including express!). There are a ton of NodeSchool tutorials on anything from node, basic JavaScript, Git, NPM and more. We're going to to the one on Express, which is called `expressworks`.

To install `expressworks`, run the following command: `npm install -g expressworks`. This is going to install `expressworks` and all of its dependencies. When it finishes, you can run `expressworks` in your terminal to start the tutorial.

`expressworks` consistss of 8 exercises. They are all assigned, except the lesson on Jade, which is optional. When you've finished them all, take a screenshot of your terminal showing the list of lessons with the `[COMPLETED]` status next to the lessons you've completed. Save the screenshot into the `10-express` folder with the file name `assignment`, commit it and push it and make a pull request.
