# Going Deeper
[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com) - a competitor to GitHub - has some amazing tutorials and resources on Git. Check them out [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials).

In particular look in to:
* [Saving Changes](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes) to learn more about `git add` and `git commit`, as well as learn about `git stash` and creating a `.gitignore` file for your repository
* [Inspecting a Repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/inspecting-a-repository) to learn more about `git status` and `git log`
* [Undoing Changes](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes) to learn about `git checkout`, `git revert`, `git reset`, and `git clean` - these are tools you'll use to clean up your git history if you make a mistake or want to change it.
* [Rewriting History](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history) to learn how to amend your last commit and to be introduced to `git rebase`
* [Comparing Workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows) to learn about how teams organize their repositories and what workflows teams follow to get the most out of git. I'm a bit proponent of the GitFlow workflow and it's what I use. Each workflow has it's advantages and disadvantages.
